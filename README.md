# LeutMesiene

The knowledge/cheatsheet of a lazy hacker who doesn't want to go through all his writeups all the time.  

### Implementation

The LeutMesiene is developed in Python, further important libraries will be identified later. The tool will consist of a commandline interface but also have a web interface. The choice for both ways was made because in a web interface everything can be structured more clearly. In addition, this tool is also a good exercise to keep up the programming skills of the owner, it is considered a win/win situation.

##### Name (LeutMesiene)

Yes quite a strange name, that is understandable. Translated it means Fun Machine but then it is written in the dialect where I come from (Bergen op Zoom). Never forget where you came from ;p
