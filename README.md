# LeutMesiene

The knowledge/cheatsheet of a lazy hacker who doesn't want to go through all his writeups all the time.  

### Implementation

The LeutMesiene is developed in Python, using default libraries for the CLI implementation and Flask with Vuetify for the web interface. Both of these interfaces are backed with a local DB-file which hold all the items (commands, tools). The choice for both ways was made because in a web interface everything can be structured more clearly and the CLI for the fast usage or for the situation when there is only a commandline available. In addition, is this tool also a good exercise to keep up the programming skills of the author, so it can be considered as a win/win situation.

##### Name (LeutMesiene)

Yes quite a strange name, that is understandable. Translated it means Fun Machine but then it is written in the dialect where I come from (Bergen op Zoom). Never forget where you came from ;p
